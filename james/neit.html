                <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering builds upon the knowledge of the
                    associate degree to give students a broader exposure to programming languages, especially
                    object-oriented languages, and deeper experience in database, web and mobile design, development and
                    implementation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A key feature of this software engineering program is a senior design project and the choice between
                    additional coursework or a cooperative learning experience in the final two terms. In the senior
                    project, each student works with a faculty member to develop and present a design project that
                    focuses in-depth on a particular topic and allows students to bring together knowledge gained
                    throughout the software engineering program.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The cooperative learning experience based on industry demand and with the approval of the IT
                    Department Chair may be available during the final two terms of the program. These experiences,
                    which may be paid or unpaid, allow students to receive college credit and to work off-campus in an
                    organization where they will practice and enhance their technical skills. Typically, and when
                    available, students will work in the same organization for the final two terms of the bachelor’s
                    degree program.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Upon completion of the software engineering program, graduates will be prepared to apply for
                    positions such as system developer, analyst, database specialist, software engineer, web programmer,
                    planner or developer. Students may also choose to continue into the NEIT Master of Science in
                    Information Technology degree program.

                <h1>Federal Work Study Program</h1>
                <br>
                Federal Work-Study provides part-time jobs for undergraduate students with financial need, allowing
                them to earn money to help pay education expenses. The program encourages community service work and
                work related to recipient's course of study. Unlike other financial aid awards, work study earnings do
                not automatically reduce tuition charges. Work Study students must work to earn the amount of their
                award each term.

                <h1>State Grants</h1>
                <br>
                State grants are based on financial need and may be offered to eligible students from their state
                of legal residence. Students should complete the FAFSA and follow any additional application
                requirements from their home state. Students should also be aware of any deadlines that are imposed by
                their home state.

                <h1>Scholarship Search Websites</h1>
                <br>
                Many private agencies, companies, clubs and civic organizations offer scholarships to help college
                students pay for their educational costs. Below are some links that any current or potential college
                student can use to search for scholarships. Private scholarships often require applicants to meet
                certain awarding criteria and adhere to strict application deadlines. The Financial Aid Office at New
                England Tech encourages all our students to seek scholarship help from private sources. However, be
                cautious when communicating with websites that promote college scholarships. Never apply for a
                scholarship that asks you to pay a fee, and do not provide your social security number, banking
                information or credit card number to any scholarship website or application.
