                    Statisticians are professionals who apply statistical methods and models to real-world problems.
                    They also collect, analyze, and interpret data, which can be used to aid in several business
                    decision-making process. When Statisticians analyze data, they look for certain patterns and based
                    on those patterns, they conclude their findings and explain why the pattern is occurring. Now there
                    are many different kinds of Statistician's. Some examples of this include Sport Statisticians,
                    Science Statisticians, Computer Statisticians, and more. But the basic view of a Statistician is
                    that they analyze and interpret data, look for patterns in that data, record their findings, and
                    explain why a pattern is occurring in the data.

                    The overall demand for the employment of mathematicians and statisticians is getting higher. It is
                    projected that the employment of mathematicians and statisticians will grow 33 percent from the year
                    2020 to 2030. This is much faster than the typical average for all occupations. To go along with
                    this, around 5,200 openings for mathematicians and statisticians are estimated for each year, on
                    average, over the course of the decade.

                    To become a Statistician, there are a few educational requirements that go into becoming a
                    Statistician and getting hired by a company. A Bachelor's degree in a field such as mathematicians,
                    economics or computer science is often required. Enrolling in courses like linear algebra, calculus,
                    statistics, probability and survey methodology, to go along with computer programming classes to
                    familiarize yourself with data analysis software. If you want to learn more about the higher levels
                    of statistics, earning a master's degree is a great way to do that.

                    With the high importance of those who are Statisticians, their salary is quite high. In
                    Massachusetts, the hourly wage for a Statistician comes out to be $52.98, $2,119 weekly, $9,184
                    monthly, and $110,208 annually. However, not all states in the United States pay Statisticians this
                    high. Mississippi only pays Statisticians $36.62 hourly, $1,465 weekly, $6,347 monthly, $76,166
                    annually.

                <article style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
                    Other examples of places in the United States that have low payment for those who are mathematicians
                    or statisticians include Florida and New Mexico. Florida is only paying statisticians $36.73 hourly,
                    $1,469 weekly, $6,366 monthly, and $76,389 annually. And New Mexico is only paying its statisticians
                    $37.93 hourly, $1,517 weekly, $6,575 monthly, and $78,901 annually. As you can see with the numbers,
                    New Mexico is paying its statisticians more than Florida, but in comparison to the United States as
                    a whole, these are some of the states that pay the lowest amount to their statisticians.
