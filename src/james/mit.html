                    The MIT community is driven by a shared purpose: to make a better world through education, research,
                    and innovation. We are fun and quirky, elite but not elitist, inventive and artistic, obsessed with
                    numbers, and welcoming to talented people regardless of where they come from.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Founded to accelerate the nation's industrial revolution, MIT is profoundly American. With ingenuity
                    and drive, our graduates have invented fundamental technologies, launched new industries, and
                    created millions of American jobs. At the same time, and without the slightest sense of
                    contradiction, MIT is profoundly global. Our community gains tremendous strength as a magnet for
                    talent from around the world. Through teaching, research, and innovation, MIT's exceptional
                    community pursues its mission of service to the nation and the world.

                <h1>Computer Science</h1>
                <br>
                <p> Computer science deals with the theory and practice of algorithms, from idealized mathematical
                    procedures to the computer systems deployed by major tech companies to answer billions of user
                    requests per day.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Primary subareas of this field include: theory, which uses rigorous math to test algorithms'
                    applicability to certain problems; systems, which develops the underlying hardware and software upon
                    which applications can be implemented; and human-computer interaction, which studies how to make
                    computer systems more effectively meet the needs of real people. The products of all three subareas
                    are applied across science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Computer science drives
                    interdisciplinary collaboration both across MIT and beyond, helping users address the critical
                    societal problems of our era, including opportunity access, climate change, disease, inequality and
                    polarization.

                    Career advising at MIT is formally coordinated by the office of Career Advising & Professional
                    Development. During 2019-2020, there were over 700 unique company engagements via career fairs,
                    on-campus recruiting, information sessions, and formal partnerships with individual companies for
                    recruiting. Meanwhile, the MIT Career Fair, organized by undergraduates, typically attracts more
                    more than 450 companies and 5,000 students every September.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    39% of the Class of 2020 went directly to graduate school. The top graduate school destinations were
                    MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia. However, of the students who don't go
                    directly to graduate school, many do so in the future. According to surveys of alumni who graduated
                    more than 10 years prior, 75% have pursued a graduate or professional degree since graduating from
                    MIT.

                    The MIT Alumni Association coordinates and supports people through events, clubs, and the Infinite
                    Connection, an online directory open to all alumni. MIT alumni also volunteer in formal service to
                    the Institute (e.g. by joining the Educational Council of alumni interviewers), as well as informal
                    service consistent with the MIT mission (e.g. by mentoring FIRST teams).

                <h1>First Year Grant</h1>
                <br>
                We provide low-income first-year students with a grant to help with the extra expenses that come
                with the transition to college, such as sheets and towels for your room, or a warm coat to make it
                through a Boston winter. The First Year Grant of $2,000 is divided equally between the fall and spring
                semesters and will credit to your student account along with other financial aid once you are registered
                for the semester. The grant is for first-year students only.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h1>Federal Grants</h1>
                <br>
                You'll automatically be considered for federal grant programs when you apply for financial aid each
                year. If you're eligible, we'll include the grants in your financial aid award. MIT administers four
                federal grant programs.

                <br>
                There are many private scholarships and grants you can apply for on your own. If you receive one, we use
                it to replace your student contribution requirement before we reduce your MIT Scholarship.
                There are many scholarship search engines that can help you find additional funding. Please know that
                you should never pay for a scholarship search service. You can also reach out to any groups or
                organizations that you have been involved with to see if they offer private scholarships. We recommend
                the following sites to get you started:
