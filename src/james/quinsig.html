                    The Web Applications Certificate is designed to provide the student with the basic knowledge and
                    skills necessary for career opportunities as an entry-level web developer or web administrator. This

                We provide low-income first-year students with a grant to help with the extra expenses that come
                with the transition to college, such as sheets and towels for your room, or a warm coat to make it
                through a Boston winter. The First Year Grant of $2,000 is divided equally between the fall and spring
                semesters and will credit to your student account along with other financial aid once you are registered
                for the semester. The grant is for first-year students only.

                There are many private scholarships and grants you can apply for on your own. If you receive one, we use
                it to replace your student contribution requirement before we reduce your MIT Scholarship.
                There are many scholarship search engines that can help you find additional funding. Please know that
                you should never pay for a scholarship search service. You can also reach out to any groups or
                organizations that you have been involved with to see if they offer private scholarships. We recommend
                the following sites to get you started:
