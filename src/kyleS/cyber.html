        <h1>
            Cyber Security
        </h1>
        <p>
            <h3>What do you need to know to be in the career of Cyber Security?</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            To get into a cyber security job for the Air Force in this case as that is what I am going for: a High School diploma,
            Bachelor's Degree in a related field or for Air Force GED with 15 college credits, or GED (General Education
            Development). A ASVAB test would have to be taken and a general score is what would be needed. A minimum ASVAB Score of
            64 in the General category or an ASVAB score of 54 on General combined with a score of 60 or better on the Cyber Skills
            Test.

            You would need to have knowledge of information systems, completion of a current Single Scope Background Investigation
            (SSBI), candidates without prior military experience are required to attend 8.5 weeks of Basic Military Training (BMT)
            at JB San Antonio-Lackland, TX; followed by technical training, must be between the ages of 17 and 39, have normal color
            vision and depth perception, be able to lift 40 lbs, completion of a current Single Scope Background Investigation
            (SSBI) that leads to the ability of an Airman being granted access to top secret or similar level material, responsible
            for preventing, and detecting and repelling cyber attacks.

            Prior knowledge of information systems is preferred but not required.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>What might I gain or lose from Cyber Security?</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to your rank, it shall go up with time and this means your pay will increase as well. Average Ranking up
            time would be Airman (E-2): 6 months, Airman First Class (E-3): 16 months, Senior Airman (E-4): 3 years, Staff Sergeant
            (E-5): 5 years, Technical Sergeant (E-6): 10.8 years, Master Sergeant (E-7): 16.1 years, Senior Master Sergeant (E-8):
            19.7 years, and Chief Master Sergeant (E-9): 22.3 years.

            A benefit you could see is bonus pay. Amounts are based on an individual's highest level of certification, giving Cyber
            Surety Specialists an opportunity to receive a bonus from $12,000 up to $20,000.

            You will gain a lot of benefits such as health insurance, military leave, retirement plan, dental insurance, loan
            repayment program, paid time off, tuition reimbursement, and life insurance.

            You will be paid $98,222 per year with a normal work time off and vacation time. However you are technically always on
            the clock and work could come 24/7.

            However there are a few things that could drive people away from this career. This would be at times very stressful like
            other jobs. The time you need to commit to this job is no easy thing. This job has very long hours and deployments. As
            you are basically on 24/7 just in case problems happen and or you are needed. Besides the high possibility of long
            hours, normal hours are about 8 hours with a 1 hour lunch.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Where would I work for a Cyber Security career?</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is work for Cyber Security in Peterson AFB, Colorado, Scott AFB, Illinois, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, Offutt AFB,
            Nebraska, Lackland AFB, Texas, and Langley AFB, Virginia just to name a few.

            In Cyber Security you will be working in an office/cubicle environment.

            I looked at military branches. The ones that offer this are the US Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Coast Guard.
