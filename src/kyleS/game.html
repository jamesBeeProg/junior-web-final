<h1>
    Game Designer
</h1>
<p>
    <h3>What do you need to know to be able to Game Design?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Well Game Designing is no easy feat you will have to have basic education such as having a High School diploma and a
    Bachelor Degree in graphic design, multimedia design or a related field.

    You should also be able to participate in brainstorming with other members of the video game development teams,
    researching information related to the game for inspiration for the game in development, overseeing the implementation
    of story elements during the game development process, assisting in the project's development and contributing to
    coding, testing or other roles, create innovative games for entertainment or education purposes, conceptualizing and
    developing characters, rules, settings and stories for this new games, pitching new game ideas to executives and
    clients, managing multiple teams and projects, prototyping new games, following industry trends and good practices,
    monitoring work and cash flows, developing design and gaming protocols, and doing quality control.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>What might I gain or lose from Game Designing?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    You can expect yourself to be able to follow your passion, express your creativity, generate tangible results, many
    different ways to get into game designing, can work independently, part-time work is available.

    You will also make on average in the US about $111,916 with 2 weeks of vacation time a year to start, with additional
    days earned over time. However, you are expected to schedule your   vacations around the needs of the project which, at
    some studios, makes it difficult to take all the vacation you've earned.

    However there are some things with game designing that may change you away from this career such as it being highly
    competitive, working long hours, independent development can be uncertain when it comes to success, pay is highly
    variable, work may be physically demanding at times.

You would also be working on average of 40 hours per week with possible more time spent depending on the project.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Where would I work for Game Design?</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Well there are many options when it comes to locations, in the US the top places to design games would be Austin, Texas,
    Seattle, Washington, Los Angeles, California, and San Francisco, California.

    Your working area would most likely be in a studio or office environment with other designers, developers, programmers,
    and game artists.

    Major Companies that offer Game Design as a career just to list a few would be Sony Interactive Entertainment, Tencent
    Holdings, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. There are also some companies that are more about a few games but making
    them as best quality possible as they could be like Nintendo of America, Rockstar Games, Bioware, and Naughty Dog.
